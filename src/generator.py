"""
src/generator.py — the GENERATOR component.

Given a query and context (retrieved chunks), produce an answer grounded in
the context. The prompt is faithfulness-first: answer ONLY from the context,
and abstain when the context doesn't contain the answer.

    from src.generator import generate
    answer = generate("what is drift?", ["chunk text 1", "chunk text 2"])

There are two entry points:
  - generate(query, context)        -> returns the full answer string (default)
  - generate_stream(query, context) -> yields the answer in chunks as it is
                                       produced, for streaming UIs and for
                                       measuring time-to-first-token (TTFT)
Both share the exact same prompt, model, and chain — the only difference is
that one waits for the whole answer and the other emits it token-by-token.

    You are a helpful teaching assistant for a course on LLM evaluations.
    Answer the student's question using ONLY the information in the context provided below.

    Rules:
    - Use ONLY information present in the context. Do not add outside knowledge.
    - Do not strengthen or overstate claims. If the context say two things are 
        "different" do not upgrade that to "separate methods" or stronger wording.
    - The context is an informal lecture transcript. Synthesize and rephrase what
        IS there - do not require the question's exact wording to appear.
    - ONLY abstain if the context contains NOTHING relevant to the question. If it contains partial information, answer with what is present.
    - If you must abstain, say exactly:
      "I don't have enough information in the course material to answer that."
    - Answer the question DIRECTLY in the first sentence. Keep supporting detail
        tight - include at most one or two examples, and only if they serve the question being asked.
    - Keep the answer clear and concise.
